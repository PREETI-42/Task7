This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on diagnostic features. The dataset undergoes cleaning by removing unnecessary columns and converting categorical labels into numeric values, followed by standardization for improved model performance. The script trains both linear and RBF kernel SVMs, performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and evaluates models with confusion matrices, classification reports, and cross-validation accuracy. Additionally, it applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce features for a 2D visualization of the decision boundary. The implementation showcases the impact of kernel choice, parameter tuning, and dimensionality reduction on classification accuracy.
